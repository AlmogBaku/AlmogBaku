I'm a **hands-on LLM consultant** dedicated to helping organizations harness the power of Large Language Models. With a
background as a serial tech entrepreneur and founder of an AI infrastructure company, I bring a unique blend of
innovation, rapid development skills, and deep technical expertise to every project.

As the founder of [GenAI Israel](http://llm.org.il), the largest GenAI practicioners community of over 5000 AI members
including engineers, researchers, CTOs, data scientists, and developers, I stay at the forefront of AI advancements,
ensuring my clients benefit from the latest innovations and best practices.

In the rapidly evolving field of LLM technology, the journey from concept to production-ready application is complex and
multifaceted. It requires a nuanced understanding of both cutting-edge AI capabilities and the practical considerations
for production deployment. My approach to LLM development is rooted in the [LLM Triangle Principles][ltp], focusing on
the critical interplay between *Model* selection, *Engineering Techniques*, and *Contextual Data* to create robust, 
scalable solutions that deliver real-world impact.

## Approach and Methodology

Drawing from extensive experience in tech leadership and startups, I've developed a methodology focused on delivering
tangible results:

1. **Flexible Engagement:** On-site in Israel or remote, typically 2-3 days per week
2. **Structured Experimentation:** Implementing a clear, step-by-step process for LLM development
3. **Objective-Driven Sprints:** Setting and achieving clear, measurable goals
4. **Collaborative Innovation:** Fostering shared insights and continuous improvement
5. **Hands-On Problem-Solving:** Direct involvement in technical implementation and debugging
6. **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring LLM initiatives support overarching business objectives
7. **Iterative Refinement:** Continuous optimization based on real-world performance data
8. **Startup pace**: Hands-on quick iterations, rapid prototyping, and agile development

This approach has consistently led to significant improvements in LLM application performance, reliability, and
cost-efficiency across various industries.

## Services

1. **Fractional CTO / "CTO-team for hire"** (2-3 days/week, hourly rate)
   Leveraging executive-level expertise for LLM and AI infrastructure projects.

2. **Strategic LLM Innovation Workshop**
   Empowering leadership teams with in-depth understanding of LLM technologies and strategies.

3. **Technical Talks and Consultations**
   Providing insights on cutting-edge AI infrastructure and large-scale LLM applications.

4. **Strategic Consulting**
   Offering expert guidance on LLM for AI-related investments.

Let's collaborate to transform your AI aspirations into tangible, business-driving solutions. Reach out to discuss how
we can tailor these services to your specific needs and goals.

Hi, I'm Almog - an **LLM engineering expert** and **a startup entrepreneur** passionate about bringing AI innovation to
life. For the past couple years, I've been:

- Author of **[The LLM Triangle Principle][ltp]** - a framework for building reliable LLM applications in production.
- Helped to **build and deploy dozens of LLM apps from idea to production** as a hands-on consultant.
- Founder of [**GenAI Israel**](https://llm.org.il) - the largest GenAI community for practitioners (Over 5000+
  engineers, CTOs, researchers, and data scientists)
- **Serial tech entrepreneur**; ex-AI infrastructure founder with extensive cloud-native experience (Kubernetes
  maintainer)

I love turning *LLM dreams into reality* - whether it's high-level strategy or diving deep into code. Let's build
something amazing with AI!

Hi, I'm Almog - an **LLM enthusiast** and **hands-on consultant** passionate about bringing AI innovation to life. For
the past couple years, I've been:

- Helping organizations build **LLM apps from strategy to production**
- Founder of [**GenAI Israel**](https://llm.org.il) - the largest GenAI community for practitioners (Over 5000+
  engineers, CTOs, researchers, and data
  scientists)
- Serving as **Fractional CTO for LLMs** - think of "CTO-team for hire", turning you into an octopus, with
  an extra pair of hands for LLM projects
- **Serial tech entrepreneur**; ex-AI infrastructure founder with extensive cloud-native experience (Kubernetes
  maintainer)

I love turning *LLM dreams into reality* - whether it's high-level strategy or diving deep into code. Let's build
something amazing with AI!

### Areas of Expertise

- üß† Advanced LLM Application Development and Strategy
- üèóÔ∏è Production-Ready AI/ML Infrastructure Architecture
- üåü Scalable Generative AI Systems Implementation
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native AI Solutions Optimized for Performance
- üöÄ Large-Scale AI Engineering for Real-World Impact
- üñ•Ô∏è Startup and entrepreneurial experience in AI and cloud technologies

## Why Work With Me

- üß≠ Strategic direction for LLM initiatives, guided by a clear, step-by-step methodology
- üõ†Ô∏è Deep understanding of LLM tools and frameworks, with a focus on production deployment
- ‚ö° Performance and cost optimization for scalable, real-world LLM solutions
- üêõ Tackling complex LLM challenges through structured experimentation and iteration
- üöÄ Innovative LLM applications designed for tangible business impact
- üèóÔ∏è Architecting robust LLM solutions that go beyond proof-of-concept
- üîß Bridging the gap between LLM research and practical implementation
- üìà Scaling LLM initiatives to meet enterprise-level demands and reliability standards

In the rapidly evolving field of LLM technology, the journey from concept to production-ready application is complex and
multifaceted. It requires a nuanced understanding of both cutting-edge AI capabilities and the practical considerations
for production deployment. My approach to LLM development is rooted in the [LLM Triangle Principles][ltp], focusing on
the critical interplay between *Model* selection, *Engineering Techniques*, and *Contextual Data* to create robust,
scalable solutions that deliver real-world impact.

## Approach and Methodology

Drawing from extensive experience in tech leadership and startups, I've developed a methodology focused on delivering
tangible results:

1. **Flexible Engagement:** On-site in Israel or remote, typically 2-3 days per week
2. **Structured Experimentation:** Implementing a clear, step-by-step process for LLM development
3. **Objective-Driven Sprints:** Setting and achieving clear, measurable goals
4. **Collaborative Innovation:** Fostering shared insights and continuous improvement
5. **Hands-On Problem-Solving:** Direct involvement in technical implementation and debugging
6. **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring LLM initiatives support overarching business objectives
7. **Iterative Refinement:** Continuous optimization based on real-world performance data
8. **Startup pace**: Hands-on quick iterations, rapid prototyping, and agile development

This approach has consistently led to significant improvements in LLM application performance, reliability, and
cost-efficiency across diverse industries - from cybersecurity and marketing to telecom, B2B, B2C applications, and many
more.

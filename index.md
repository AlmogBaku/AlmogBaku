Hi, I'm Almog - an **LLM enthusiast** and **hands-on consultant** passionate about bringing AI innovation to life. For
the past couple years, I've been:

- Helping organizations build **LLM apps from strategy to production**
- Founder of [**GenAI Israel**](https://llm.org.il) - the largest GenAI community for practitioners (Over 5000+
  engineers, CTOs, researchers, and data scientists)
- Serving as **Fractional CTO for LLMs** - think of "CTO-team for hire", turning you into an octopus, with
  an extra pair of hands for LLM projects
- **Serial tech entrepreneur**; ex-AI infrastructure founder with extensive cloud-native experience (Kubernetes
  maintainer)

I love turning *LLM dreams into reality* - whether it's high-level strategy or diving deep into code. Let's build
something amazing with AI!

### Areas of Expertise

- üß† Advanced LLM Application Development and Strategy
- üèóÔ∏è Production-Ready AI/ML Infrastructure Architecture
- üåü Scalable Generative AI Systems Implementation

## Why Work With Me

I'm not your typical consultant. With **hands-on experience** building *dozens of LLM applications* from strategic
planning to production, I offer **practical insights** to help you navigate the *complex landscape of AI
implementation*.

You should consider working with me if:

- You're unsure how to **systematically improve** your LLM products and need a hands-on expert
- You feel **overwhelmed by the flood** of AI tools and want practical, experience-based guidance
- You need an expert to **evaluate your AI infrastructure** and provide actionable, technical recommendations
- You're struggling to move from **PoC to production-ready** LLM applications and require direct implementation support
- You want to **align your LLM strategy** with business objectives through concrete, executable plans
- You want to **optimize LLM performance and accuracy** or **reduce costs** at scale with real-world techniques
- You're looking for _hands-on_ guidance in **nurturing AI ideas and innovations** into **full-fledged products**, from
  strategic conception to market-ready implementation

In the fast-paced LLM field, **demos are easy, but production-ready apps are challenging**. I bridge this gap using the
[**LLM Triangle Principles**][ltp], a unique technique I developed to create robust, scalable solutions with real-world
impact - crucial for both **business success** and **technical validation**.

## Approach and Methodology

Drawing from extensive experience in tech leadership and startups, I've developed a methodology focused on delivering
tangible results:

1. **Flexible Engagement:** On-site or remote, 2-3 days/week
2. **Structured Experimentation:** Clear LLM development process
3. **Goal-Oriented Sprints:** Focused on measurable outcomes
4. **Hands-On Problem-Solving:** Direct technical involvement
5. **Strategic Alignment:** LLM initiatives support business goals
6. **Continuous Optimization:** Refining based on real-world data
7. **Startup Pace:** Rapid prototyping and agile development

This **battle-tested methodology**, detailed in my [LLM development whitepaper][llm-dev-proc], *consistently improves*
LLM application **performance**, **reliability**, and **cost-efficiency**. It's proven effective across diverse
industries - from cybersecurity and marketing to telecom, B2B, and B2C - leveraging my *broad market experience* to
drive innovation.
